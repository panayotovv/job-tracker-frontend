# DEV.BG Job Tracker 🇧🇬
A full-stack job tracking platform built on top of dev.bg. A Python scraper keeps a live PostgreSQL database of every job listing on the site, and a React frontend lets you browse, apply, and track each application through a full hiring pipeline.

## ✨ Features

## 🕷️ Smart Scraping Engine
A Python scraper crawls every job category on dev.bg and stores clean, normalized records in PostgreSQL. Raw HTML is never saved — only structured data.

## ⏱️ Dual Cron Strategy
Two cron jobs keep the database fresh. A full category sweep runs daily to keep every listing up to date. A lightweight first-page-only poll runs every 15 minutes to catch new posts in near real-time without hammering the database.

## 🤝 Polite & Idempotent
A 5-second delay between category requests keeps the scraper respectful — no rate limiting or blocking encountered. Deduplication is handled at the database level with `ON CONFLICT DO NOTHING`, making every scrape run fully idempotent.

## 🔐 User Authentication
Secure login and registration using JWT. Tokens are issued on login and validated on every protected endpoint — no third-party auth service.

## 📋 Application Pipeline
Track every job application through a full hiring funnel:
Applied → Interview Incoming → Offer Received / Rejected

## 📊 Personal Analytics
Your profile page gives you an overview of your job search activity — applications sent, pipeline breakdown, and more.
